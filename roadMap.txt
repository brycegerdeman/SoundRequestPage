THE PROJECT

Option 1: Custom file (sound) hosting server.

    - Has a form page to submit a banner ID and upload sound file
    - Uploaded file will be named "[bannerID].mp3" for easy access per student

Option 2: Using existing hosting server and link upload.

    - Has a form page to submit a banner ID and link to externally hosted mp3

Important notes:

    - Need a thorough disclaimer for what kind of content cannot be uploaded
    - How to deal with multiple submissions (allow only one per user?)

Other ideas:

    - Create a whole new wrapper site for the Q2 tables;
        - Can query the Q2 table site for all the necessary data,
          with custom design and functionality
        - Easier to play custom sounds and also fixes issues with
          refresh rate, etc.
